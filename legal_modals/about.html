    <main>
        <p>Welcome to Odin Recipes! This website isn't run by a big company or a team of professional chefs. It's a personal project, built purely for the joy of **learning web development** through The Odin Project curriculum.</p>

        <p>My goal with Odin Recipes is to practice and apply HTML and CSS skills by creating a functional and (hopefully!) appealing collection of recipe pages. Every line of code on this site is a step in my learning journey, from structuring the content to making it look good with CSS.</p>

        <p>While the recipes here are simple and fun, the real "secret ingredient" is the code behind them! It's an ongoing experiment in building a complete, basic website from the ground up.</p>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**Simple, Everyday Recipes:** Practical dishes like lasagna, kebabs, pizza, and bread, perfect for home cooks.</li>
            <li>**Clean Code:** An emphasis on well-structured HTML and clean, maintainable CSS (even if it's all in one file for now!).</li>
            <li>**A Learning Experience:** A direct result of applying concepts from web development courses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Connect & Learn</h2>
        <p>While there are no social media links or contact forms for this learning project, I hope exploring the site inspires you on your own learning journey, whether it's coding or cooking!</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting, and enjoy the recipes!</p>
