        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There's nothing quite like the aroma and taste of freshly baked bread. This recipe is perfect for beginners, guiding you through the simple steps to create a delicious, crusty loaf with a soft interior. Enjoy it warm with butter, soup, or your favorite spread!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1 packet (2¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1½ cups warm water (105-115°F / 40-46°C)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: Activate Yeast:</strong> In a large bowl, dissolve sugar and yeast in warm water. Let stand for 5-10 minutes, until foamy.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: Mix Dough:</strong> Add the olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Mix well with a wooden spoon or a stand mixer with a dough hook. Gradually add the remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: Knead:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: First Rise:</strong> Lightly grease a clean large bowl with olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl, turning once to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: Shape:</strong> Gently punch down the risen dough to release the air. Shape it into a loaf and place it into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan, or on a baking sheet for a free-form loaf.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6: Second Rise:</strong> Cover the loaf pan or shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap or a towel. Let rise in a warm place for another 30-45 minutes, or until nearly doubled.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7: Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) during the last 15 minutes of the second rise. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 200-210°F (93-99°C). If the crust is browning too quickly, you can tent it loosely with foil.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8: Cool:</strong> Remove bread from the pan immediately and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. This helps prevent the bottom from becoming soggy.</li>
        </ol>
