        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 - 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Your favorite toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for drizzling)</li>
            <li>Optional: Dried oregano or fresh basil for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). If you have a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: Prepare Dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out your pizza dough to your desired thickness and shape (round or rectangular). Carefully transfer it to a baking sheet, pizza peel, or directly onto your preheated pizza stone/steel.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: Add Sauce and Cheese:</strong> Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: Add Toppings:</strong> Arrange your chosen toppings evenly over the cheese. Drizzle a little olive oil over the edges of the crust for a golden finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: Bake:</strong> Bake for 12-18 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned. Baking time may vary depending on your oven and chosen crust thickness.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6: Serve:</strong> Carefully remove the pizza from the oven. Let it cool for 2-3 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!</li>
